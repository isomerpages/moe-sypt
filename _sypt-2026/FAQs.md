<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Q: What constitutes a team for the competition?
<br>A: Each team should consist of at least two students and two teachers-in-charge.
A typical team comprises three students.</p>
<p>Q: Can I take part if there are only two members in my team?
<br>A: Yes, but it is not recommended as the workload on the members will
be much heavier.</p>
<p>Q: Can a student be registered for more than one team?
<br>A: No. Teachers may be registered for more than one team but not the students.</p>
<p>Q: Are foreign students eligible for the competition?
<br>A: Yes. SYPT is open to all (Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners) secondary
and pre-university students studying in Singapore schools (not inclusive
of international schools). However, only Singaporeans and Permanent Residents
are eligible to be selected for IYPT.</p>
<p>Q: What is the cost for registration?
<br>A: There is no registration fee involved.</p>
<p>Q: Which category should I register for?
<br>A: Current secondary 3 and below students should be registered as Category
B. Current secondary 4 and above students should be registered as Category
A.</p>
<p>Q: How many teams can each school register?
<br>A: Each school can send in a maximum of 2 teams. IP schools with 6-year
programmes can send 2 teams per category.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>​Working on problems</h4>
<p>Q: My school does not have high-end equipment capable of generating highly
precise data. In that case, will my team be disadvantaged in the experimentation
stage?
<br>A: The jurors understand this limitation. As such, the emphasis is placed
on correct modeling of physics concepts and less on precision of experimentation.</p>
<p>Q: I am keen to participate but I am not confident of applying difficult
theory to explain my team's experimental observations.
<br>A: Difficult theory may not be the best theory. The jurors want to see
how the team conceptualise the experiment, understand the physics behind
it and model the phenomena observed. It will suffice if the team is able
to apply simple theory to explain the observations.</p>
<h4>Shortlisting</h4>
<p>Q: Does the whole team have to be present during shortlisting?
<br>A: Preferably, but if it is not possible, then at least one student member
needs to be around for shortlisting.</p>
<p>Q: Are teacher mentors allowed to attend the shortlisting session?
<br>A: Yes, teachers are encouraged to attend the shortlisting but they should
not communicate with the student members during the shortlisting process.</p>
<p>Q: My teacher is a nominated juror for the competition. Does he/she sit
on the panel for shortlisting?
<br>A: No. All jurors for shortlisting are independent jurors. School jurors
will only be involved in the SYPT Finals, though they will not be in fights
involving the schools they mentor.</p>
<p>Q: What are the possible outcome of the shortlisting?
<br>A: The independent jurors will rank the teams during the shortlisting.
Top eight teams will be shortlisted to participate in the Physics Fights
at the SYPT Finals based on juror recommendation.</p>
<h4>SYPT Physics Fight</h4>
<p>Q: What is the format of the Physics Fight (PF) at the SYPT Finals?
<br>A: Each PF will follow the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opponent challenges the Reporter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporter team captain accepts or rejects the challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Reporter prepares his/her presentation (2 mins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Reporter presents the proposed solution to the problem (10 mins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Opponent orally questions the Reporter (2 mins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Opponent prepares his/her presentation (4 mins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Opponent takes the floor and leads an oral discussion with the Reporter.
The Opponent must engage in discussion within 5 minutes of taking the floor.
(12 mins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Opponent takes the floor to summarise the discussion (1 min)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final concluding remarks from the Reporter (1 min)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Questions from each jury member (10 mins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All jurors write comments and scores for Reporter and Opponent (5 mins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open scoring: Head juror requests all jurors to reveal their scores to
everyone and request jurors with highest and lowest score to comment (5
min)</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: What are the role coefficients of Reporter and Opponent?
<br>A: Reporting score is multiplied by a coefficient of 3.0 or lower, depending
on the penalty awarded (see answer to next question). Opposing score is
multiplied by a coefficient of 2.0.</p>
<p>Q: How many problems should our team prepare for the PF?
<br>A: In a PF, a team may reject the challenge of four different problems
without penalty. From then on, every subsequent rejection will result in
a penalty of a drop in coefficient of 0.2 (starting from 3.0).&nbsp;
<br>Most schools will work on at least 2 problems as reporter and 2 other
problems as opponent. However, if time allows, teams are encouraged to
work on more problems.</p>
<p>Q: In the PF, how many times can the same member report and oppose?
<br>A: Each member in the team can report/oppose at most twice out of the
four PFs (i.e.&nbsp;report once&nbsp;and oppose once, report twice or oppose
twice).</p>
<p>Q: As opponent team in PF, what are the problems that we can't challenge
the reporter team to?
<br>A: The problems that an opponent cannot challenge will be informed by
the chief juror in the room. Problems cannot be challenged if</p>
<p>(a) presented by the opponent earlier,
<br>(b) opposed by the opponent earlier,
<br>(c) presented by the reporter earlier,
<br>(d) rejected by the reporter earlier</p>
<p>There must be at least 2 problems left to challenge, otherwise the conditions
are released in the order a, b, c, d.</p>
<h4>SYPT Final Fight</h4>
<p>Q: What is the Final Fight?
<br>A: The two teams with the highest total score in the PF will take part
in the Final Fight.</p>
<p>Q: What are the details of the Final Fight?
<br>A: Everything is reset for the Final Fight including scores, coefficient,
problems allowed and reporters allowed. Within 15 minutes after announcement,
both teams must choose their problems to report. The team with the highest
score will choose 1 problem and decide the order of reporting. The team
with the 2nd highest score will choose 2 problems in order of preference
(They will present their 2nd choice if the problem is the same as the opponent).</p>
<p>​Q: In the event that a registered participant is not able to attend the
finals, can the school send a replacement?
<br>A: Schools must inform the MOE CPDD officers of any changes to the team
members after the stipulated deadline. The replacement can only be made
after approval is given by MOE and the YPT committee. Note that only the
participants present on the day of the finals will be presented with awards.
Schools should be fair to the students who are shortlisted and only send
replacements if the students shortlisted are unable to attend the finals.</p>
