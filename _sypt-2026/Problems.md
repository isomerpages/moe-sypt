<h3>Category A</h3>
<p><strong>A1. Twisted spaghetti&nbsp;</strong>
<br>When a bundle of spaghetti is twisted, it might withstand higher transverse
(side) forces than a straight, untwisted bundle. Investigate the response
of a twisted bundle to transverse stress and identify the optimal twist
that maximises tolerance to transverse stress.</p>
<p><strong>A2. Ring fountain</strong>
<br>When a flat metal ring falls from a certain height into a water tank,
it generates a fountain that can shoot water high into the air. How does
the maximum height of the fountain depend on the ring’s parameters?</p>
<p><strong>A3. Oil flow&nbsp;</strong>
<br>A thin layer of cooking oil on a flat metal surface flows outwards when
heated. Investigate the phenomenon and its dependence on relevant parameters.</p>
<p><strong>A4. Magnetic accelerator</strong>
<br>Fix magnets in pairs onto a metal sheet as shown. If you attach two magnetic
discs onto an axle this “vehicle” will accelerate over the rows of magnets
under certain conditions. Investigate the phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>A5. Levitation control&nbsp;</strong>
<br>When arranged in a specific configuration, small graphite sheets can levitate
on neodymium magnets. By shining light onto the surface of the graphite
sheet, it is possible to control its movement. Explain and investigate
the phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A6. Submerged crater</strong>
<br>If you release sand or similar granular material in a container filled
with water, the material will sink to the bottom and may form a crater-like
structure. Explain and investigate the phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>A7. Autumn coin</strong>
<br>The motion of a coin falling to the bottom of a tank filled with liquid
can be remarkably&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;the fluttering and tumbling of a
falling autumn leaf. Investigate how the motion of the coin depends on
relevant parameters.</p>
<p><strong>A8. Magnetic Newton’s cradle&nbsp;</strong>
<br>Repulsing, non-touching magnets are used instead of colliding balls to
make a new type of Newton’s cradle. The new cradle can act in a similar
way to a regular&nbsp;cradle, but&nbsp;can also exhibit other interesting
behaviour. Explain and study the movement of this magnetic cradle.</p>
<p><strong>A9. Travelling flame&nbsp;</strong>
<br>A flame can propagate continuously around a ring-shaped trough containing
a thin layer of flammable liquid. Investigate how the characteristics of
this travelling flame depend on relevant parameters.</p>
<h3>Category B</h3>
<p><strong>B1. Twisted spaghetti&nbsp;</strong>
<br>When a bundle of spaghetti is twisted, it might withstand higher transverse
(side) forces than a straight, untwisted bundle. Investigate the response
of a twisted bundle to transverse stress and identify the optimal twist
that maximises tolerance to transverse stress.</p>
<p><strong>B2. Invent yourself</strong>
<br>A self-starting siphon can be made using a piece of rigid tubing bent
into a specific shape. When the siphon is partially immersed in water,
it begins siphoning water without the need for initial suction. Investigate
how the relevant parameters, such as&nbsp;the geometry, affect the siphoning
process.</p>
<p><strong>B3. Electrical damping&nbsp;</strong>
<br>A magnet suspended by&nbsp;a spring&nbsp;will display simple harmonic
motion when displaced. If the magnet oscillates within a coil connected
to a resistor, its motion will be&nbsp;damped. Investigate the factors
that affect the damping.</p>
<p><strong>B4. Elastic wave dynamics&nbsp;</strong>
<br>Suspend a metal ball from a fixed support using a rubber band and twist
it many times around its vertical axis. When the ball is&nbsp;released,&nbsp;standing
waves&nbsp;are formed&nbsp;on the rubber band. Investigate this phenomenon
and study how the wave depends on relevant parameters.</p>
<p><strong>B5. Flipo&nbsp;Flip</strong>
<br>A&nbsp;Flipo&nbsp;Flip toy can roll for multiple turns even though its
shape is not circular. Investigate how its motion depends on parameters
such as geometry and the initial release conditions.</p>
<p><strong>B6. Tennis racket theorem</strong>
<br>When an object with different principal moments of inertia about each
axis is thrown while it rotates, it can suddenly start rotating around
an axis different from the one it was initially rotating about. Investigate
how the rotational motion of such an object is affected by relevant parameters
during its free fall.</p>
<p><strong>B7. Sweet monochromator&nbsp;</strong>
<br>Pass linearly polarised white light through a column of sugar solution.
When transmitted light is observed through a polariser it may appear coloured.
Rotate the polariser, and the transmitted light colour may change. Construct
such a sweet monochromator and optimise for the narrowest light wavelength
bandwidth.</p>
<p><strong>B8. The singing ruler</strong>
<br>When a ruler is clamped at one end and struck, it oscillates and emits
a characteristic sound. Investigate how the sound depends on&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;parameters.</p>
<p><strong>B9. Crystal Critters</strong>
<br>Observe the evaporation of a drop of table salt solution on a warm hydrophobic
surface. After the water evaporates, a variety of characteristic crystal
shapes remain. Research and explain this phenomenon.</p>
<h3>General Tips</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Model the theories mathematically beyond qualitative observations, predict
and tally predictions with observations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the source of information/equations for accuracy to ensure the accuracy
of basic concepts e.g. direction of refracted rays, use of appropriate
equations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appropriate fitting of line e.g. checking the physical appropriateness
of &nbsp;y-intercept. A line fit may only be useful if there is a comparison
with a mathematical model. Otherwise, observing a general trend of the
data points may be sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use experimental data to verify if theory is valid instead of relating
different parameters without further investigation into the related physical
insights</p>
</li>
