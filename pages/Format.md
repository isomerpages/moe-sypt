<br>Stage 2: Physics Fight/Poster Presentation</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>Since 2019, the Poster Presentation has been included to encourage teams
to continue working on the problems. Typically, all teams participate in
shortlisting and only teams that are not shortlisted will participate in
Poster Presentation. However, since 2022, teams may proceed directly to
the poster presentation without needing to prepare for the shortlisting.</p>
<p>Teams who are interested to participate in the Physics Fight will undergo
a shortlisting. Any teams who are not shortlisted are still welcome to
participate in the Poster Presentation.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Shortlisting</h4>
<p>Shortlisting will be held in person at on&nbsp;16 and 23 Nov 2024 for
Categories B and A respectively.
<br>For the shortlisting, teams will prepare a 12-minute presentation comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>10 minutes oral presentation to a panel of jurors on one main problem,
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 minutes of discussion on the progress of any two other problems in the
registered category*.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the presentation, registered teams will participate in a 10-15 min
Q&amp;A session with a panel of jurors regarding their presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The problems may be chosen from any of the SYPT problems in the registered
Category (click <a href="https://iyptsypt.wixsite.com/sypt/sypt-2023" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>&nbsp;for
the list of problems).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For schools with more than one team, the&nbsp;main problem&nbsp;presented
by each team&nbsp;must&nbsp;be different. This applies across Categories
as well, i.e. Cat A and Cat B teams cannot both present on the same main
problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category A - for participants in JC1 / IP5 / PU1 (or equivalent) and below as of 2024;</em>
<br><em>Category B - for participants in Sec 3 / IP3 (or equivalent) and below as of 2024.</em>
</p>
<h4>Physics Fight</h4>
<p>SYPT 2025 will be held on-site at CHIJ St Nicholas Girl's School for Category
B and National Junior College for Category A. The dates are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>15 Feb 2025 - Finals: Category B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>22 Feb 2025&nbsp;- Finals: Category A</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with previous years, teams will still present 2 problems and oppose
2 problems in the category list. This can include the problems used during
shortlisting. Problems will be based on IYPT challenge rules.</p>
<p>Details on the rules and guidelines for the online event will be updated
soon. The scoring rubric can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10EFThfMyvM0F9-Z1blPLBrAUEk0_vmHe/view?usp=share_link" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.
This rubric is adapted from the IYPT rubric.</p>

<h4>Poster Presentation</h4>
<p>Teams will prepare a poster on one of the problems. This can be the same
problem that was used for shortlisting.</p>
<p>On the day of the finals, teams will present their work to jurors. Teams
will be judged on a clear presentation that focuses on correct key physics
theory that explains the phenomenon. Teams should also be prepared to present
their work to their peers attending as audience members, or other participants.</p>
