<p>Singapore first participated in the <a href="http://iypt.org/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>International Young Physicistsâ€™ Tournament (IYPT)</u></a>&nbsp;in
2009 when it was hosted in Tianjin, China. The Singapore team has been
performing very well at this annual competition,&nbsp; emerging as champions
at the following editions: 23rd (Vienna, 2010), &nbsp;26th (Taipei, 2013),
27th (Shrewbury, United Kingdom, 2014), 28th (Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand,
2015), 29th (Ekaterinburg, Russia, 2016), 30th (Singapore, 2017) , 31st
(Beijing, China 2018) and 32nd (Warsaw, Poland 2019).</p>
<p>In 2020 and 2021, the Singapore team did not participate in the IYPT due
to COVID-19 restrictions. However, the Singapore team participated in equivalent
online tournaments, namely the New Zealand Young Physicists' Tournament
in 2020 and the Online Young Physicists' Tournament in 2021. They emerged
as champions in both years.</p>
<p>2022 was a unique year where Singapore saw an opportunity to provide more
students the chance to participate in the competition. Two teams were formed,
one for the 35th (Timisoara, Romania 2022) IYPT and one for the Online
Young Physicists' Tournament 2022. In both competitions, our teams emerged
as the first runner up.</p>
