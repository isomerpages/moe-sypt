<h1>What is IYPT?</h1>
<p><strong>The International Young Physicists’ Tournament (IYPT)</strong>,
sometimes referred to as the “Physics World Cup”, is a scientific competition
between teams of secondary school students. It mimics, as close as possible,
the real-world scientific research and the process of presenting and defending
the results obtained.</p>
<p>Participants have almost a year to work on 17 open-ended inquiry problems.
A good part of the problems involves easy-to-reproduce phenomena presenting
unexpected behaviour.</p>
<p>The aim of the solutions is not to calculate or reach “the correct answer”
as there is no such notion here. The Tournament is rather conclusions-oriented
as participants have to design and perform experiments, and to draw conclusions
argued from the experiments’ outcome.</p>
<p>The competition itself is not a pen-and-paper competition but an enactment
of a scientific discussion (or a defence of a thesis) where participants
take the roles of Reporter, Opponent and Reviewer and are evaluated by
an international Jury.</p>
<p>The beauty of the Tournament is that teams can take quite different routes
to tackle the same problem. As long as they stay within the broadly defined
statement of the problem, all routes are legitimate and teams will be judged
according to the depths reached by their investigations.</p>
<p>In 2013, IYPT was awarded the medal of the&nbsp;International&nbsp;Union
of Pure and Applied Physics&nbsp;(IUPAP)&nbsp;in&nbsp;recognition of its
inspiring and wide-ranging contribution to physics education that has touched
many lives and countries, over the past 25 years.</p>

<h4>Singapore's Performance at IYPT</h4>
<p>Singapore first participated in the <a href="http://iypt.org/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>International Young Physicists’ Tournament (IYPT)</u></a>&nbsp;in
2009 when it was hosted in Tianjin, China. The Singapore team has been
performing very well at this annual competition,&nbsp;emerging as champions
at the following editions: 23rd (Vienna, 2010), &nbsp;26th (Taipei, 2013),
27th (Shrewbury, United Kingdom, 2014), 28th (Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand,
2015), 29th (Ekaterinburg, Russia, 2016), 30th (Singapore, 2017) , 31st
(Beijing, China 2018), 32nd (Warsaw, Poland 2019), 37th (Budapest, Hungary
2024) and 38th (Lund, Sweden 2025).</p>
<p>In 2020 and 2021, the Singapore team did not participate in the IYPT due
to COVID-19 restrictions. However, the Singapore team participated in equivalent
online tournaments, namely the New Zealand Young Physicists' Tournament
in 2020 and the Online Young Physicists' Tournament in 2021. They emerged
as champions in both years.</p>
<p>2022 was a unique year where Singapore saw an opportunity to provide more
students the chance to participate in the competition. Two teams were formed,
one for the 35th (Timisoara, Romania 2022) IYPT and one for the Online
Young Physicists' Tournament 2022. In both competitions, our teams emerged
as the first runner up.</p>
<h4>Congratulations, Team Singapore!</h4>

<p>Singapore is back at the 38th IYPT, held in Lund, Sweden. The Singapore
team emerged as the Champion! Congratulations Team Singapore!</p>
<p>The Singapore team comprised Austin Liu Zi Rui (team captain), Lucas Tan
Yixuan and Wang Duanyu from Raffles Institution, Kabilan Ezhilarasan and
Jonathan Huang Kaijie from NUS High School of Math and Science. &nbsp;The
team was led by Dr Chang Sheh Lit of Singapore Polytechnic, Mr Sze Guan
Kheng from Raffles Institution, Mr Lim Wei Hao from MOE and coached by
Mr Chen Guangyuan and Mr Gao Kehan.</p>
