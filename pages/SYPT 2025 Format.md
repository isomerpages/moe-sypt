<h2>SYPT 2025 Format</h2>
<p>Since 2019, the Poster Presentation has been included in SYPT to encourage
teams to continue working on the SYPT problems at different levels. This
year, a new route has been offered for teams who wish to focus only on
one main problem. These teams may proceed directly to the poster presentation
without needing to prepare for the shortlisting.
<br>Teams who are interested to join the Main Fights will undergo a shortlisting
selection for the Main Fights. Any teams who attend the shortlisting but
are not selected for the Main Fights are still welcome to join the Poster
Presentation.
<br>The number of teams participating in the various categories may vary from
year to year up to the discretion of the jurors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Requirements for citation of sources used</u>
<br>Jurors must be able to clearly distinguish the team's original work&nbsp;from
the work of others.
<br>Teams are responsible for making <strong>clear&nbsp;distinctions</strong>&nbsp;between
their&nbsp;own work and work that has been re-used/ existing research,
such as by&nbsp;<strong>clearly citing&nbsp;all&nbsp;sources&nbsp;used</strong> during
the presentation <strong>on the respective&nbsp;slide</strong>. Not doing
so&nbsp;may result not only in a lower score but potentially also a&nbsp;disciplinary
procedure in cases that shall be considered as plagiarism.</p>
