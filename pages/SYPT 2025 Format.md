<h2>SYPT 2025 Format</h2>
<p>Since 2019, the Poster Presentation has been included in SYPT to encourage
teams to continue working on the SYPT problems at different levels. This
year, a new route has been offered for teams who wish to focus only on
one main problem. These teams may proceed directly to the poster presentation
without needing to prepare for the shortlisting.
<br>Teams who are interested to join the Main Fights will undergo a shortlisting
selection for the Main Fights. Any teams who attend the shortlisting but
are not selected for the Main Fights are still welcome to join the Poster
Presentation.
<br>The number of teams participating in the various categories may vary from
year to year up to the discretion of the jurors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Requirements for citation of sources used</u>
<br>Jurors must be able to clearly distinguish the team's original work&nbsp;from
the work of others.
<br>Teams are responsible for making clear&nbsp;distinctions&nbsp;between
their&nbsp;own work and work that has been re-used/ existing research,
such as by&nbsp;clearly citing&nbsp;all&nbsp;sources&nbsp;used during the
presentation on the respective&nbsp;slide. Not doing so&nbsp;may result
not only in a lower score but potentially also a&nbsp;disciplinary procedure
in cases that shall be considered as plagiarism.</p>
<h2>Shortlisting</h2>
<p>Shortlisting will be held in person at on&nbsp;16 and 23 Nov 2024 for
Categories B and A respectively.
<br>For the shortlisting, teams will prepare a 12 minute presentation comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>10 minutes oral presentation to a panel of jurors on one main problem,
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 minutes of discussion on the progress of any 2 other problems in the
registered category*.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the presentation, registered teams will participate in a 10-15 min
Q&amp;A session with a panel of jurors regarding their presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The problems may be chosen from any of the SYPT problems in the registered
Category (click <a href="https://iyptsypt.wixsite.com/sypt/sypt-2023" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>&nbsp;for
the list of problems).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For schools with more than one team, the&nbsp;main problem&nbsp;presented
by each team&nbsp;must&nbsp;be different. This applies across Categories
as well, i.e. Cat A and Cat B teams cannot both present on the same main
problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category A - for participants in JC1 / IP5 / PU1 (or equivalent) and below as of 2024;</em>
<br><em>Category B - for participants in Sec 3 / IP3 (or equivalent) and below as of 2024.</em>
</p>
<p>â€‹An email will be sent to all registered teams with further instructions
and schedule for the shortlisting.</p>
<h2>Main Fight</h2>
<p>SYPT 2025 will be held on-site at CHIJ St Nicholas Girl's School for Category
B and National Junior College for Category A. The dates are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>15 Feb 2025 - Finals: Category B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>22 Feb 2025&nbsp;- Finals: Category A</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with previous years, teams will still present 2 problems and oppose
2 problems in the category list. This can include the problems used during
Shortlisting. Problems will be based on IYPT challenge rules.</p>
<p>Details on the rules and guidelines for the online event will be updated
soon.</p>
<p>The scoring rubric can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10EFThfMyvM0F9-Z1blPLBrAUEk0_vmHe/view?usp=share_link" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.
This rubric is adapted from the IYPT rubric.</p>
<p>It is important to note the requirements for citation of sources used.</p>

<h2>Poster Presentation</h2>
<p>Teams will prepare a poster on one (1) of the problems from the Category
list. This can be the same problem that was used for shortlisting.</p>
<p>On the day of the Finals, teams will present their work to jurors at the
tournament. Teams are advised that they will be judged on a clear presentation
that focuses on correct key physics theory that explains the phenomenon.
This presentation should be about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Teams should also be prepared to present their work to their peers attending
as audience members, or other participants.</p>
<p>If you wish to attend this event as an audience member, please approach
your school's teacher-in-charge, if applicable, or send an email to <a href="mailto:LIM_Wei_Hao@moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LIM_Wei_Hao@moe.gov.sg</a> or
