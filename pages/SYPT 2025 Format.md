<h2>SYPT 2025 Format</h2>
<p>Since 2019, the Poster Presentation has been included in SYPT to encourage
teams to continue working on the SYPT problems at different levels. This
year, a new route has been offered for teams who wish to focus only on
one main problem. These teams may proceed directly to the poster presentation
without needing to prepare for the shortlisting.
<br>Teams who are interested to join the Main Fights will undergo a shortlisting
selection for the Main Fights. Any teams who attend the shortlisting but
are not selected for the Main Fights are still welcome to join the Poster
Presentation.
<br>The number of teams participating in the various categories may vary from
year to year up to the discretion of the jurors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Requirements for citation of sources used</u>
<br>Jurors must be able to clearly distinguish the team's original work&nbsp;from
the work of others.
<br>Teams are responsible for making <strong>clear&nbsp;distinctions</strong>&nbsp;between
their&nbsp;own work and work that has been re-used/ existing research,
such as by&nbsp;<strong>clearly citing&nbsp;all&nbsp;sources&nbsp;used</strong> during
the presentation <strong>on the respective&nbsp;slide</strong>. Not doing
so&nbsp;may result not only in a lower score but potentially also a&nbsp;disciplinary
procedure in cases that shall be considered as plagiarism.</p>
<h2>Shortlisting</h2>
<p>Shortlisting will be held in person at on&nbsp;16 and 23 Nov 2024 for
Categories B and A respectively.
<br>For the shortlisting, teams will prepare a 12 minute presentation comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>10 minutes oral presentation (83%) to a panel of jurors on <strong><u>one main problem</u></strong>,
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 minutes of discussion (17%) &nbsp;on the progress of <strong><u>any 2 other problems</u></strong> in
the registered Category*.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the presentation, registered teams will participate in a 10-15 min
Q&amp;A session with a panel of jurors regarding their presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The problems may be chosen from any of the SYPT problems in the registered
Category (click <a href="https://iyptsypt.wixsite.com/sypt/sypt-2023" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>&nbsp;for
the list of problems).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For schools with more than one team, the&nbsp;<strong>main problem</strong>&nbsp;presented
by each team&nbsp;<strong><em>MUST&nbsp;</em>be different</strong>. This
applies across Categories as well, i.e. Cat A and Cat B teams cannot both
present on the same main problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category A - for participants in JC1 / IP5 / PU1 (or equivalent) and below as of 2024;</em>
<br><em>Category B - for participants in Sec 3 / IP3 (or equivalent) and below as of 2024.</em>
</p>
<p>â€‹An email will be sent to all registered teams with further instructions
and schedule for the shortlisting.</p>
