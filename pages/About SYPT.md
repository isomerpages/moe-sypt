<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>The Singapore Young Physicists’ Tournament (SYPT) tests participants'
ability to solve complicated real-world physics problems. In a typical
Fight, the Reporter has to present their solutions to proposed problems
in a convincing way, defending their stand through scientific discussions
with the Opponent.</p>
<p>The competition seeks to bring students through a process of what physicists
do; from research to modeling, experimentation and finally to an oral defense
before peers and experts. The SYPT provides authentic learning experiences
in the learning of physics. Participants of the SYPT stand to represent
the country in the <a href="https://www.iypt.org/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>International Young Physicists’ Tournament (IYPT).</u></a> Singapore
hosted the IYPT for the first time in 2017.</p>
<p>The IYPT International Organising Committee (IOC) decides on 17 problems
to be used for the tournament. These problems involve different aspects
of Physics and are often related to phenomena that confront us in our everyday
lives. The IYPT problems are deliberately formulated in an open-ended way,
and cannot be solved within a short time using standard methods in pen-and-paper
examination setting.</p>
<p>The objective of the IYPT is for teams to prepare not only a scientifically
sound and correct solution, but also for participants to present their
solution in a convincing way and to respond spontaneously to criticisms
and counter-solutions of the opponent. This learning model is similar to
the actual process of science investigation, from framing a question to
identifying possible solutions for a problem.</p>
<p>The SYPT is a scaled-down and modified version of the IYPT, making use
of the IYPT's problems.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements for citation of sources used</strong>
<br>Teams are responsible for making <strong>clear distinctions</strong>&nbsp;between
their own work and work that has been re-used/ existing research. Teams
should <strong>clearly cite all sources used</strong> during the presentation <strong>on the respective slide</strong> or
otherwise. Not doing so&nbsp;may result not only in a lower score but potentially
also a&nbsp; &nbsp; disciplinary procedure in cases that shall be considered
as plagiarism.</p>
